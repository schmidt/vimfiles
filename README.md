# schmidt's vimfiles

This is my very own collection of vim settings, mostly consisting of plugins
written by other smart minds and some customizations by myself - probably also
inspired by others.

## Usage

Clone the repository into `~/.vim`

    git clone https://github.com/schmidt/vimfiles ~/.vim

Initialize all submodules

    cd ~/.vim
    git submodule update --init

Activate the settings by creating a `.vimrc` which uses these `vimfiles`

    echo 'source ~/.vim/vimrc' > ~/.vimrc

Your done.
